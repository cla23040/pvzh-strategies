        So you've downloaded Plants VS Zombies: Heroes (from here on out called PVZH or "Heroes"). You've played the tutorial, scrounged up a bunch of cards and immediately got you Pea deck wrecked by someone just spamming imps. Why did their strategy work and yours didn't? On this page I will discuss some fundamental strategies that should help you to make your own decks and the way you play them much better. I won't be just telling you what decks to use, as the meta changes so quickly that what's good today may be gone tomorrow. You may also select "plants" and "zombies" in the header to see team specific strategies, but it's recommended you read this page first

          <button class="accordion">Correcting the Tutorial</button>
          <div class="panel">

          <p>The tutorial teaches you to use all your sun or brains every turn as you loose them for next turn. I counter with another concept, you also don't get the card back. If you don't wish to be in many moments where you wish you still had that card, take a breather and just hold off on playing it. At the same time, a card played is so much more valuable than a card you never end up using as it does a couple things: clogs a lane, exists until at least the end of the turn, if not until next turn, and forces the opponent to decide what they're gonna do about it.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Immediately Helpful Tricks</button>
          <div class="panel">
          <p>Super powers are overpowered and the most important cards to consider when building a deck or fighting an opponent. All powers are 1 cost cards that you are guaranteed to get one of every game. Since they are the only cards you're guaranteed to get, and you may get multiple every game, making sure you build with them in mind is of the utmost importance. All standard super powers are designed to be the equivalent of 2-2.5 cost cards, the best example I can think of is Meteor Strike and Berry Blast, both do 3 damage, but Meteor Strike costs 1. Hero specific super powers are designed to be the equivalent of 3-4 cost cards, there isn't really a solid direct comparison, but look over the powers and you'll see what I say is true. You must always think about what powers you and your opponent still have, and play around it.</p>
          <p>The block meter will switch between a mechanic you praise for it's ingenuity and curse with all your might depending on how your last game went. As stated above, super powers are crazy strong, so you don't want your opponent to have them, therefore unless the advantage of the card hitting the opponent or being on the field is great enough, you never want to play a card that only does 1 damage as it will fill their block meter and give them powers. If they play a card that doesn't really do much that does 1 damage, let it hit you, as you will get free powers and it's one less lane they can play in.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the fact that the block meter must always roll a 1, 2, or 3 it can be played around to great extent. If you practice calculating probability on the fly it can help you determine which lane to put a card in. A general rule of thumb though is to start by putting cards generally in the middle ground lanes as you then have the space to put hard hitters either to the left or the right depending on the current state of the block meter. If you have a hard hitter that's likely to survive the turn, it can be worth it to put it in the left most lanes as the game always goes from left to right so they have to deal with it before they can do what they want to.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Actually Winning Games</button>
          <div class="panel">
          <p>The secret to winning games is to have a deck with a clear purpose and then to adapt to whatever your opponent is thinking of doing. While reading people's minds is a skill that comes with time and practice, the same philosophies you use when building a deck can be very helpful when deciding what to do and what your opponent is thinking. The most important thing to know is the three types of play: Aggro, Control, and Tempo. Being able to quickly figure out which one your opponent is playing is a skill that takes time, but coming to terms with is surprisingly simple and fast. These three types of play are something that you choose to do from moment-to-moment, turn-to-turn, over the whole game, as well as being what you build your deck around</p>
          <p>Aggro is an extremely simple to understand type, it's short for aggressive. On the scope of a deck the idea is to whittle down your opponent's health to zero before they have a chance to set anything up or to play their finishers. On the play-to-play scope it either forces the opponent to have to do something about you right now instead of building their own thing up, or it punishes them for playing too slowly. If your opponent comes out immediately swinging or is playing a lot of cards that don't trade or kill your cards, they're probably playing an Aggro deck, it would be wise to try and kill their cards and force the game into the midrage or the late game. What this looks like is very different for plants and zombies, and will be covered in more detail on their respective pages.</p>
          <p>Control is also a simple strategy where you basically prevent your opponent from doing things by either killing their card or preventing them from playing it outright. On the deck scope this looks like having a lot of cards that clear the field or draw cards and then hit them with a big finisher they either can't do anything about, or don't have the resources to do anything about. It's not usually hard to describe why one would play Control as your opponent not doing anything or being unable to is a very efficient victory indeed. If your opponent is skipping every turn you don't play, or constantly just playing cards that stops you from doing anything, they're likely playing Control. Try to play cards that take multiple cards to deal with and build up a wall, most finishers require an empty lane or are late game enough that you can whittle down their resources before they're able to do anything.</p>
          <p>Tempo is the hardest to explain, it comes from the idea that you're controlling not your opponent directly, but the pace of the game itself. On a deck scope it's playing cards that either have great stats and are therefore hard to do anything about or cards that combo with each other and have large results. It might be easier to think about it in contrast to the other two, Aggro and Control are both about this turn right now, Aggro trying to maximize damage this turn, and control trying to prevent this turn from coming to fruition, Tempo is more about how this turn will effect next turn. I say this because it's easy to think of tempo as just "building a wall", but a wall won't kill your opponent, so it's more about your cards sticking to the game for several turns. It's defiantly the most "you're gonna have to keep playing to get it" strategy, sports decks are probably the most direct and budget form of tempo decks. If your opponent seems to be creating minions with good stats or combo potential, you might want to start rushing them down.</p>
