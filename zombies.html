        <h2>General Zombies Strategies</h2>
        <p>Your entire life as a zombie hinges on tricking the opponent or forcing them to make trade-offs. The tricks turn is your time to shine as it's the last thing that happens every turn, therefore gravestone "when revealed" effects or teleports are your lifeline. Technically there are strategies where your Tempo just gets away from the plant, but it often still has to be supported by tricks or gravestones. As you go first in your minions turn, most of your 1 cost or 2 cost units should force the plant to make a choice to control you, or are hard enough to kill they last to the next turn, for zombies this is needed in all strategies. Universally good cards for this are quickdraw con man, headstone carver, and cheese cutter. All either are constant threats or force the opponent to deal with them lest you draw ahead too quickly.</p>

          <h2>The Brain-Tingling Types of Play</h2>
          <p>Aggro is very different for zombies and can require a lot of brain power from you to do right. On a play-by-play basis it usually actually means letting a heavy hitting opponent hit face with a controlling trick or some other method like smoke bombs. On a deck level you need cards that either move, have <img src="images/strikethrough.webp" class="unit-trait-symbol" alt="">strikethrough, or <img src="images/overshoot.webp" class="unit-trait-symbol" alt="">overshoot. Another way is to take with you tricks or environments that buff a single zombie a lot in one turn so that if they ignore a small fry you can punish them, and it remains a problem they need to take care of next turn. Both Tempo like plays and Control plays are probably needed to pull it off. General cards that can help you in each class is smoke bombs and pogo bouncer for sneaky, fruitcake and moon base z for crazy, black hole and rolling stone for hearty, alien ooze and extinction event for beastly, and finally beam me up and rocket science for brainy. These go well with aggro as they either deal with the hard to deal with plants, or help you hit the face of your opponent directly.</p>
          <p>Control is very easy for zombies as the tricks turn is last, however don't rely entirely on tricks as the plants have cards to prevent you from using tricks like forget me nuts, black eye peas, dark matter dragoon fruit, and brainanas. Your finisher must also either be a trick so they can't do anything about it, or something that's impossible or difficult to block. This is why trickster is a popular choice, but zombot is not. Trickster is an instant 6 damage to face, or if you teleport it, a 12 damage to face card. While zombot destroys all plants on the field, which sounds great at first, until your opponent blocks it with a 1 cost card and then uses the 8 sun they have left over to do whatever they want to you. Otherwise it's fairly simple, a clear field is a clear mind for a control deck user.</p>
          <p>Tempo can be very interesting as the hardest part is getting your zombies past a turn, but once they've made it past a turn, it's usually easy to keep building them up. Many gravestones have decent health and have some self protecting "when revealed" ability. Many zombie tricks can buff multiple zombies at a time, but they often aren't useful if you don't have a full field so try and keep a balance between stuff that makes a single zombie "sticky" vs incrementally buffing all zombies on the field. If you have to choose one, go with the keeping a single zombie around option as you often have one or two that you really need to protect and it statistically tends to be more helpful in the long run. You might want to bring finishers just like control as it can get hard to break through the plants being able to choose where to fortify reactively, however your finishers in a tempo deck may look more like a final mission to the face, or a card that gives <img src="images/frenzy.webp" class="unit-trait-symbol" alt="">frenzy to charge down as an effective Tempo deck tends to leave plants playing defensively due to low health in the midrange or end game</p>
