        So you've downloaded Plants VS Zombies: Heroes (from here on out called PVZH or "Heroes"). You've played the tutorial, scrounged up a bunch of cards and immediately got you Pea deck wrecked by someone just spamming imps. Why did their strategy work and yours didn't? On this page I will discuss some fundamental strategies that should help you to make your own decks and the way you play them much better. I won't be just telling you what decks to use, as the meta changes so quickly that what's good today may be gone tomorrow. You may also select "plants" and "zombies" in the header to see team specific strategies, but it's recommended you read this page first
</p>

      <p>--Correcting the Tutorial--</p>

      <p>
        The tutorial teaches you to use all your sun or brains every turn as you loose them for next turn. I counter with another concept, you also don't get the card back. If you don't wish to be in many moments where you wish you still had that card, take a breather and just hold off on playing it. At the same time, a card played is so much more valuable than a card you never end up using as it does a couple things: clogs a lane, exists until at least the end of the turn, if not until next turn, and forces the opponent to decide what they're gonna do about it.
      </p>
      <p>--Immediately Helpful Tricks--</p>
      <p>
        Super powers are overpowered and the most important cards to consider when building a deck or fighting an opponent. All powers are 1 cost cards that you are guaranteed to get one of every game. Since they are the only cards you're guaranteed to get, and you may get multiple every game, making sure you build with them in mind is of the utmost importance. All standard super powers are designed to be the equivalent of 2-2.5 cost cards, the best example I can think of is Meteor Strike and Berry Blast, both do 3 damage, but Meteor Strike costs 1. Hero specific super powers are designed to be the equivalent of 3-4 cost cards, there isn't really a solid direct comparison, but look over the powers and you'll see what I say is true. You must always think about what powers you and your opponent still have, and play around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The block meter will switch between a mechanic you praise for it's ingenuity and curse with all your might depending on how your last game went. As stated above, super powers are crazy strong, so you don't want your opponent to have them, therefore unless the advantage of the card hitting the opponent or being on the field is great enough, you never want to play a card that only does 1 damage as it will fill their block meter and give them powers. If they play a card that doesn't really do much that does 1 damage, let it hit you, as you will get free powers and it's one less lane they can play in.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to the fact that the block meter must always roll a 1, 2, or 3 it can be played around to great extent. If you practice calculating probability on the fly it can help you determine which lane to put a card in. A general rule of thumb though is to start by putting cards generally in the middle ground lanes as you then have the space to put hard hitters either to the left or the right depending on the current state of the block meter. If you have a hard hitter that's likely to survive the turn, it can be worth it to put it in the left most lanes as the game always goes from left to right so they have to deal with it before they can do what they want to.</p>
      <p>--Actually Winning Games--</p>
      <p>The secret to winning games is to have a deck with a clear purpose and then to adapt to whatever your opponent is thinking of doing. While reading people's minds is a skill that comes with time and practice, the same philosophies you use when building a deck can be very helpful when deciding what to do and what your opponent is thinking. The most important thing to know is the three types of play: Aggro, Control, and Tempo. Being able to quickly figure out which one your opponent is playing is a skill that takes time, but coming to terms with is surprisingly simple and fast. These three types of play are something that you choose to do from moment-to-moment, turn-to-turn, over the whole game, as well as being what you build your deck around</p>
      <p>Aggro is an extremely simple to understand type, it's short for aggressive. On the scope of a deck the idea is to whittle down your opponent's health to zero before they have a chance to set anything up or to play their finishers. On the play-to-play scope it either forces the opponent to have to do something about you right now instead of building their own thing up, or it punishes them for playing too slowly. If your opponent comes out immediately swinging or is playing a lot of cards that don't trade or kill your cards, they're probably playing an Aggro deck, it would be wise to try and kill their cards and force the game into the midrage or the late game. What this looks like is very different for plants and zombies, and will be covered in more detail on their respective pages.</p>
      <p>Control is also a simple strategy where you basically prevent your opponent from doing things by either killing their card or preventing them from playing it outright. On the deck scope this looks like having a lot of cards that clear the field or draw cards and then hit them with a big finisher they either can't do anything about, or don't have the resources to do anything about. It's not usually hard to describe why one would play Control as your opponent not doing anything or being unable to is a very efficient victory indeed. If your opponent is skipping every turn you don't play, or constantly just playing cards that stops you from doing anything, they're likely playing Control. Try to play cards that take multiple cards to deal with and build up a wall, most finishers require an empty lane or are late game enough that you can whittle down their resources before they're able to do anything.</p>
      <p>Tempo is the hardest to explain, it comes from the idea that you're controlling not your opponent directly, but the pace of the game itself. On a deck scope it's playing cards that either have great stats and are therefore hard to do anything about or cards that combo with each other and have large results. It might be easier to think about it in contrast to the other two, Aggro and Control are both about this turn right now, Aggro trying to maximize damage this turn, and control trying to prevent this turn from coming to fruition, Tempo is more about how this turn will effect next turn. I say this because it's easy to think of tempo as just "building a wall", but a wall won't kill your opponent, so it's more about your cards sticking to the game for several turns. It's defiantly the most "you're gonna have to keep playing to get it" strategy, sports decks are probably the most direct and budget form of tempo decks. If your opponent seems to be creating minions with good stats or combo potential, you might want to start rushing them down.</p>

      <h3>Plants (Page 2)</h3>
      <p>
        --General Plant Strategies --
      </p>
      <p>Plants play units and tricks second, which is so powerful. You get to choose which trades to make and battles to play, your victory depends entirely on whether or not you can predict what's inside gravestones and what tricks they have and can play, however if the zombie hero's cards aren't that scary, the plant basically wins automatically. That's not to say that plants are overpowered and you can slack off, I'm simply demonstrating just how powerful being able to play second really is. It's why the zombies victory or loss depends on what they do in their tricks turn, and cards that prevent that like black eye peas, forget me nuts, and blockbuster can completely sway the game</p>
      <p>--The Types of Play and Plants--</p>
      <p>Aggro is extremely simple for plants, if you want to play aggressively get a high damage card and just, don't play it in front of a zombie. There's also the strategy of using strikethrough cards so you can deal with the zombie in front of you and still do damage to the opponent. The main thing you need to decide is whether or not you want to build Tempo or not. If the opponent saves most of their brains and they've been shown to play controlling cards, it's probably wise to build tempo or pass. If you're fairly certain that they can't do anything about it, putting it down is worth the risk in most situations. Remember the goal is to get your opponent's health to 0, not to make an impenetrable fortress or to have all the health</p>
      <p>Tempo also tends to be fairly simple for plants, make winning trades with zombies, or play something in an empty lane that will grow into a problem or create other problems. The main goal is to force the opponent to have to make choices they don't want to make: Do they spend resources to slow you down? Or do they let you build up as they try to do the same? One mental pitfall people make is starting tempo too late as it doesn't require the opponent to make difficult choices, nor is it fast enough to leave them behind. If your first tempo based move is for example starch lord, you will only be starting tempo on turn 5 at the earliest if you even draw it in the first place. You wouldn't build a defense when your enemies are at your gates. Aggro cards tend to go well with tempo cards for plants, as it lets you choose turn by turn whether to hit them hard or to build yourself up. Another side effect of Aggro cards is that they may need to spend next turn defending or controlling them letting you build tempo more safely</p>
      <p>Control can actually be fairly tricky for plants. Sometimes it's really simple, just destroy the zombies right after they play them, but when you add gravestones, tricks, and teleports to the mix, you can loose to a strictly aggro deck if you're not careful. When deck building it's important to weigh just how impactful gravestones are against you. It also may be important to pack healing so you can jump back into the game. It can often be useful to bring some Aggro cards with you that have a secondary ability so they have to choose whether or not to spend their next turn dealing with it, and it can bring you closer to that finisher you've been packing. On a play to play basis it's very simple as you go second and can basically use anything for control</p>

      <h3>Zombies (page 3)</h3>
      <p>
        --General Zombies Strategies--
      </p>
      <p>Your entire life as a zombie hinges on tricking the opponent or forcing them to make trade-offs. The tricks turn is your time to shine as it's the last thing that happens every turn, therefore gravestone "when revealed" effects or teleports are your lifeline. Technically there are strategies where your Tempo just gets away from the plant, but it often still has to be supported by tricks or gravestones. As you go first in your minions turn, most of your 1 cost or 2 cost units should force the plant to make a choice to control you, or are hard enough to kill they last to the next turn, for zombies this is needed in all strategies. Universally good cards for this are quickdraw con man, headstone carver, and cheese cutter. All either are constant threats or force the opponent to deal with them lest you draw ahead too quickly.</p>
      <p>--The Brain-Tingling Types of Play--</p>
      <p>Aggro is very different for zombies and can require a lot of brain power from you to do right. On a play-by-play basis it usually actually means letting a heavy hitting opponent hit face with a controlling trick or some other method like smoke bombs. On a deck level you need cards that either move, have strikethrough, or overshoot. Another way is to take with you tricks or environments that buff a single zombie a lot in one turn so that if they ignore a small fry you can punish them, and it remains a problem they need to take care of next turn. Both Tempo like plays and Control plays are probably needed to pull it off. General cards that can help you in each class is smoke bombs and pogo bouncer for sneaky, fruitcake and moon base z for crazy, black hole and rolling stone for hearty, alien ooze and extinction event for beastly, and finally beam me up and rocket science for brainy. These go well with aggro as they either deal with the hard to deal with plants, or help you hit the face of your opponent directly.</p>
      <p>Control is very easy for zombies as the tricks turn is last, however don't rely entirely on tricks as the plants have cards to prevent you from using tricks like forget me nuts, black eye peas, dark matter dragoon fruit, and brainanas. Your finisher must also either be a trick so they can't do anything about it, or something that's impossible or difficult to block. This is why trickster is a popular choice, but zombot is not. Trickster is an instant 6 damage to face, or if you teleport it, a 12 damage to face card. While zombot destroys all plants on the field, which sounds great at first, until your opponent blocks it with a 1 cost card and then uses the 8 sun they have left over to do whatever they want to you. Otherwise it's fairly simple, a clear field is a clear mind for a control deck user.</p>
      <p>Tempo can be very interesting as the hardest part is getting your zombies past a turn, but once they've made it past a turn, it's usually easy to keep building them up. Many gravestones have decent health and have some self protecting "when revealed" ability. Many zombie tricks can buff multiple zombies at a time, but they often aren't useful if you don't have a full field so try and keep a balance between stuff that makes a single zombie "sticky" vs incrementally buffing all zombies on the field. If you have to choose one, go with the keeping a single zombie around option as you often have one or two that you really need to protect and it statistically tends to be more helpful in the long run. You might want to bring finishers just like control as it can get hard to break through the plants being able to choose where to fortify reactively, however your finishers in a tempo deck may look more like a final mission to the face, or a card that gives frenzy to charge down as an effective Tempo deck tends to leave plants playing defensively due to low health in the midrange or end game</p>
