          <h2>General Plant Strategies</h2>
          <p>Plants play units and tricks second, which is so powerful. You get to choose which trades to make and battles to play, your victory depends entirely on whether or not you can predict what's inside gravestones and what tricks they have and can play, however if the zombie hero's cards aren't that scary, the plant basically wins automatically. That's not to say that plants are overpowered and you can slack off, I'm simply demonstrating just how powerful being able to play second really is. It's why the zombies victory or loss depends on what they do in their tricks turn, and cards that prevent that like black eye peas, forget me nuts, and blockbuster can completely sway the game</p>

          <h2>The Types of Play and Plants</h2>
          <p>Aggro is extremely simple for plants, if you want to play aggressively get a high damage card and just, don't play it in front of a zombie. There's also the strategy of using <img class="unit-trait-symbol" src="images/strikethrough.webp" alt="">strikethrough cards so you can deal with the zombie in front of you and still do damage to the opponent. The main thing you need to decide is whether or not you want to build Tempo or not. If the opponent saves most of their brains and they've been shown to play controlling cards, it's probably wise to build tempo or pass. If you're fairly certain that they can't do anything about it, putting it down is worth the risk in most situations. Remember the goal is to get your opponent's health to 0, not to make an impenetrable fortress or to have all the health</p>
          <p>Tempo also tends to be fairly simple for plants, make winning trades with zombies, or play something in an empty lane that will grow into a problem or create other problems. The main goal is to force the opponent to have to make choices they don't want to make: Do they spend resources to slow you down? Or do they let you build up as they try to do the same? One mental pitfall people make is starting tempo too late as it doesn't require the opponent to make difficult choices, nor is it fast enough to leave them behind. If your first tempo based move is for example starch lord, you will only be starting tempo on turn 5 at the earliest if you even draw it in the first place. You wouldn't build a defense when your enemies are at your gates. Aggro cards tend to go well with tempo cards for plants, as it lets you choose turn by turn whether to hit them hard or to build yourself up. Another side effect of Aggro cards is that they may need to spend next turn defending or controlling them letting you build tempo more safely</p>
          <p>Control can actually be fairly tricky for plants. Sometimes it's really simple, just destroy the zombies right after they play them, but when you add gravestones, tricks, and teleports to the mix, you can loose to a strictly aggro deck if you're not careful. When deck building it's important to weigh just how impactful gravestones are against you. It also may be important to pack healing so you can jump back into the game. It can often be useful to bring some Aggro cards with you that have a secondary ability so they have to choose whether or not to spend their next turn dealing with it, and it can bring you closer to that finisher you've been packing. On a play to play basis it's very simple as you go second and can basically use anything for control</p>
